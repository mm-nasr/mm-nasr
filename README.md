### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my profile. I'm an engineer passionate about robotics, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence.

My experience and knowledge spans the following topics:

* Modeling and Control

* Orbital Mechanics ([sample](https://github.com/mm-nasr/orbital_maneuver))

* Robotics (ROS, Python, C++, IoT)
  1. Multi-robot SLAM
  2. Robot voice command
  
* Self Driving Vehicles
  1. State Estimation: EKF, UKF
  1. Control: PID, MPC, state-feedback, geometric control, optimal control
  1. Mission Planning: Path planning, behavioral planning
  1. Coursera Specialization: [Self-Driving Cars](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/self-driving-cars?#courses):
      1. [Introduction to Self-Driving Cars](https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/certificate/CPNCYFAF5S8P)

* Reinforcement Learning
  1. Q-Learning & SARSA
  2. Deep Reinforcement Learning: DQN, DDPG, etc...
  3. Continual Learning and Catastrophic Forgetting on Atari 2600 using DQN.
  4. Documenting my journey to mastering Reinforcement Learning [here](https://github.com/mm-nasr/road2RL) (recent)
  
* Iâ€™m currently learning more about Reinforcement Learning and DQL and looking forward to applying them to ground and aerial robotics!

Educational Background:
* MASc in Computer Engineering from [The University of Waterloo](https://uwaterloo.ca/)
* BSc in Aerospace Engineering from [Zewail City of Science and Technology](https://www.zewailcity.edu.eg/main/index.php?lang=en)
